This project contains the data processing and modelling steps for training a ham/spam classifier.<br>
The dataset consists of 5572 SMS labelled messages taken from the [UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).<br>
One notebook takes a thorough look at the data and trains Scikit-learn classifiers, whilst the other notebook fine-tunes a Roberta transformer model for the same task.
