This project contains the data processing and modelling steps for training a ham/spam classifier.<br>
The dataset consists of 5572 SMS labelled messages taken from the [UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).<br>

One notebook explores the dataset in detail, applying text cleaning and pre-processing techniques, before training Scikit-Learn classifiers. The other notebook fine-tunes a Roberta Transformer LLM for the same task.
